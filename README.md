### Course Description

This course provides a practical, hands-on overview of game development. Students learn how to make games from scratch by using a game engine to code behaviors and manipulate assets. Individual game development concepts are introduced incrementally. Students are required to demonstrate their understanding of these concepts through creative project work. Some programming experience is required.

### Tools and Languages Used

For this class, we primarily worked in Unity with C#.

### Portfolio Website

The only file provided on this repository is `index.html`, and this is because our first task was to create a basic [portfolio website](https://mywebspace.quinnipiac.edu/bajackson1/200/index.html) to publish our assignments. If you go to the file, you will be directed to the website where you can see the individual assignments and final project.
